# Implementation of HAIID principles

## Explainability (lab4)
The important pixels influencing the model's decision are visualized.

## User Control (lab5)
The user can manually enter the correct number.

## Transparency (lab6)
The characteristics of the model (Random Forest, importance of features) are shown.

## Accessibility (lab7)
Command interface with text navigation.

## Feedback Loop (lab8)
The user's responses are saved in the log and can be used for retraining.

## Error Handling (lab9)
Image loading error handling.

## Feedback Loop
The user's response is saved in `data/feedback_log.csv'. This can be used later to retrain the model.
